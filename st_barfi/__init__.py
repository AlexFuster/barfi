# that is used to create instances of the component. We're naming this
# function "_component_func", with an underscore prefix, because we don't want
# to expose it directly to users. Instead, we will create a custom wrapper
# function, below, that will serve as our component's public API.

# It's worth noting that this call to `declare_component` is the
# *only thing* you need to do to create the binding between Streamlit and
# your component frontend. Everything else we do in this file is simply a
# best practice.

# Create a wrapper function for the component. This is an optional
# best practice - we could simply expose the component function returned by
# `declare_component` and call it done. The wrapper allows us to customize
# our component's API: we can pre-process its input args, post-process its
# output value, and add a docstring for users.

# "name" argument without having it get recreated.
