# Barfi

**A visual Flow Based Programming widget library that integrates into your existing workflow.**

Existing visual Flow Based Programming (FBP) libraries in Python run in their own/separate environment. They are not integratable into existing workflows, nor can they be used as a component in your existing scripts. The main limitation for the existing Python libraries in this space is the lack of domain specific use-case. 

Barfi aims to bridge that. And, will add domain specific use-cases.
