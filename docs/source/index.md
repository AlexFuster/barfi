# Barfi

**A visual Flow Based Programming widget library that integrates into your existing workflow.**

Existing visual Flow Based Programming (FBP) libraries in Python run in their own/separate environment. They are not integratable into existing workflows, nor can they be used as a component in your existing scripts. The other main limitation for the existing Python libraries is the lack of domain specific components. 

Barfi aims to bridge these limitation. And, will aim to add domain specific components.
